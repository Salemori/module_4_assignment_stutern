                Hi! I am Aduragbemi Oduntan, a technology enthusiast to the
                core. I started up my journey into tech few months back with the
                sole aim of becomming a sort after back-end software developer.
                Surfing the internet has always been my thing and it was as a
                result of this that I became so keen on knowing the secret
                behind how technology works. My passion for technology was
                birthed from several reasons, which includes its dynamic
                feature. As it evolves everyday, it keeps me on my toes to want
                to learn more and not stop learning. I won't forget to add how
                tech has helped me develop my problem solving skills. It makes
                me think smarter and helped me learn how to break down problems
                in little sections and to find a step by step process of solving
                the it. Most importantly, the ability to impact lives at
                different level and scale. The idea that I can create something
                that can inpact someone across the world now, or in the future
                is what drives my passion for Technology. For me, the most
                attractive aspect of technology is problem solving. Problem
                solving is a challenge I have always loved and will always love.

                Stutern has played an important role in my tech journey. In this
                program, I started off learning about source control using GIT
                and GitHub. The importance of tracking changes in source code.
                Moving forward I am learning about the building blocks of a web,
                both the structure and the styling (front-end), HTML and CSS.
                CSS topics covering introduction to CSS, casecading hierarchy,
                box model, major properties in CSS and a lot more. This has arm
                with the knowledge of styling a webpage. So far, the journey has
                been amazing, as I have upgraded from being a total novice in
                development to a beginner. It is so fulfilling. The journey
                continues and I am still aiming for more...

                Padding is the inner space between the content and the border
                of your box. Border is the perimeter of the box. Borders can be
                invisible or they could be a thick colored line like the green
                one pictured above. Margin is the outer space (or lack of space)
                surrounding the box. Imagine that you have a set of framed and
                matted photographs hanging on a wall. Each photo is surrounded
                by a mat that puts space between the photo and the frame. That
                space would be the padding. The frame encloses the mat and the
                image. That would be the border. Each picture has a set amount
                of space around the outside. That is the margin. If two pictures
                are handing side by side with four inches between them, then we
                might say that they each have a two inch margin. The margin is
                the distance between an element and something else. In Web
                development it is particularly important to know the size of
                each if we are placing elements side by side within a parent
                container.
